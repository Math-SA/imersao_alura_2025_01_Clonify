# AI Collaboration Log: Clonify

## [02/02/2025]
### Context
After completing the changes I considered necessary to migrate the clone into a react project, I sought guidance on best practices, as I am rather new to React.

### Goal
Apply best practices and review my code.


### Prompt
#### Context Priming
Luri seems to be a RAG app which already has the necessary context priming. I only provided my code when necessary.
#### Full log 
See luri_chat.md

### Implementation
I followed Luri's guidance and made changes to my code.

### Results
I figured it would be best to properly study accessibility before trying to apply it. The other recommendations were simple to apply and made sense.
"

### Reflection
Luri was very useful, but is a proprietary AI which I won't be able to access in the future. 

**Next Steps:**  
1 - Study Responsive design applied to React.
2 - Study Accessibility and how to apply it to React projects.
